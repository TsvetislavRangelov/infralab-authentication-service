## Description
Infralab AUTH is an authentication service built upon the OAuth 2.0 Protocol. Students from the third semester of ICT & Infrastructure @ Fontys UAS use this service to authenticate into a web portal, from which they can get an OpenVPN certificate that they can use for their projects.

## Authors and acknowledgment
I built this together with Aleksandra Krasteva, Shuhei Hagiwara, Max Arts and Yorian Verhees in my 4th semester of University.
